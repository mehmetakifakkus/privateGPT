**Why Google Colab?**

LLM, large language models have become an interesting area of tech lately. While working on a project, I faced one issue, storage space in my local disk. I had to figure out an alternative. Google Colab worked well for me.

I realised other folks might face this same issue. This repo will guide you on how to; re-create a private LLM using the power of GPT. [Explainer Video](https://youtu.be/vxUdJO0MoT0).
